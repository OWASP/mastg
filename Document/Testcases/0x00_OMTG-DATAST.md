# Testing Data Storage and Privacy Issues

## Overview

Data Storage and privacy issues concerns about the availability of sensitive information within the shipped app, the file system of the mobile device or when itâ€™s communicating to the defined endpoints. The app should be as lightweight as possible regarding the data it contains.

The definition of sensitive data might differ in different countries and/or industries through different laws and regulations. Examples of sensitive data might include:

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII), like date of birth, address or full name.
- Payment data (e.g. Credit Card data)
- Credentials
- IP addresses

To be able to look for sensitive data, it should first be defined and clear to all involved parties what sensitive data is in context of the App.

### OMTG-DATAST-002: Test for Sensitive Data Disclosure in Log Files
There are many legit reasons to create log files on a mobile device, for example to keep track of crashes or errors that are stored locally when being offline and being sent to the application developer/company once online again or for usage statistics. However, logging sensitive data such as credit card number and session IDs might expose the data to attackers or malicious applications.
