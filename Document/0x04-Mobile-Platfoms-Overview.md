# Mobile Platforms Overview

(... TODO ...) A brief, general overview before moving on to the OS-specific chapters.

The current state of mobile application development largely revolves around two popular platforms, Apple iOS and Google Android. According to the latest figures available (IDC / Gartner), Android worldwide market share was 87.8% (3Q16) while iOS one was 11.5%. Other OS (including Blackberry and Windows Phone) are less than 0.5% (0.1% and 0.4% respectively). The forecast for consolidated market shares in 2020 are 85.6% for Android versus 14.2% for iOS. Competitors are having a hard time to exist in this market.

For Apple, their iOS operating system is based on Darwin (BSD). iOS runs on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch devices. Additionally, watchOS which powers Apple Watch devices, is also closely based on iOS.
iOS is a closed-source operating system, and Apple is its sole owner.

For Google, their Android operating system is based on the Linux kernel. It powers a variety of devices from smartphones, tablets, televisions and wearable devices.
Android is an open-source operating system that can be freely downloaded from the internet. Thanks to its openess and low cost, it is implemented by many manufacturers all over the world. While this can be viewed as a positive side, the downside is that, while Apple can keep the form factor of mobiles running iOS under control (screen size, ...), Google can hardly control the use of Android and a lot of different form factors exist, often implementing different versions of Android. Also, an interesting point on the security point of view is that manufacturers often add their own applications and layers of code on top of Android in order to customize and try to improve user experience. These software parts sometimes embed security vulnerabilities, that manufacturers are sometimes slow to fix. As a result, some mobiles are not patched when vulnerabilities are discovered and may remain vulnerable for a long time.

Both Apple and Google have their respective digital distribution platform; for Apple this being the App Store for iOS applications and for Google, via their Play Store for Android applications.
Both platforms differ in terms of number of available applications and publishing process.
