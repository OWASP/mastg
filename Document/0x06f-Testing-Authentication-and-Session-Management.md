## Testing Authentication

### Verify that Users Are Properly Authenticated

It is important to clarify that this control is at the server side, so the testing will be the same for iOS and Android applications. Please look at "Verify that Users Are Properly Authenticated" in Android for a detailed explanation of this test case.

### Testing Session Management

It is important to clarify that this control is at the server side, so the testing will be the same for iOS and Android applications. Please look at "Testing Session Management" in Android for a detailed explanation of this test case.


### Testing the Logout Functionality

It is important to clarify that this control is at the server side, so the testing will be the same for iOS and Android applications. Please look at "Testing the Logout Functionality" in Android for a detailed explanation of this test case.

### Testing Biometric Authentication

#### Overview

-- TODO [Provide a general description of the issue "Testing Biometric Authentication".]

#### Static Analysis

-- TODO [Describe how to assess this given either the source code or installer package (APK/IPA/etc.), but without running the app. Tailor this to the general situation (e.g., in some situations, having the decompiled classes is just as good as having the original source, in others it might make a bigger difference). If required, include a subsection about how to test with or without the original sources.] --

-- TODO [Confirm purpose of remark "Use the &lt;sup&gt; tag to reference external sources, e.g. Meyer's recipe for tomato soup<sup>[1]</sup>."] --

-- TODO [Add content for "Testing Biometric Authentication" with source code] --

#### Dynamic Analysis

-- TODO [Describe how to test for this issue "Testing Biometric Authentication" by running and interacting with the app. This can include everything from simply monitoring network traffic or aspects of the app’s behavior to code injection, debugging, instrumentation, etc.] --

#### Remediation

-- TODO [Describe the best practices that developers should follow to prevent this issue "Testing Biometric Authentication".] --
