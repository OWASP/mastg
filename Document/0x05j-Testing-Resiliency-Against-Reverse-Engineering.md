## Testing Resiliency Against Reverse Engineering

### Testing Root Detection

#### Overview

In the context of anti-reversing, the goal of root detection is to make it a bit more difficult to run the app on a rooted device, which in turn impedes some tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use. As with most other defenses, root detection is not highly effective on its own, but having some root checks sprinkled throughout the app can improve the effectiveness of the overall anti-tampering scheme.

On Android, we define the term "root detection" a bit more broadly to include detection of custom ROMs, i.e. verifying whether the device is a stock Android build or a custom build.

##### Common Root Detection Methods

###### SafetyNet

SafetyNet is an Android API that creates a profile of the device using software and hardware information. This profile is then compared against a list of white-listed device models that have passed Android compatibility testing. Google recommends using the feature as "an additional in-depth defense signal as part of an anti-abuse system" [1].

What exactly SafetyNet does under the hood is not well documented, and may change at any time: When you call this API, the service downloads a binary package containing the device vaidation code from Google, which is then dynamically executed using reflection. An analysis by John Kozyrakis showed that the checks performed by SafetyNet also attempt to detect whether the device is rooted, although it is unclear how extacly this is determined [2].

To use the API, an app may the SafetyNetApi.attest() method with returns a JWS message with the *Attestation Result*, and then check the following fields:

- ctsProfileMatch: Of "true", the device profile matches one of Google's listed devices that have passed  Android compatibility testing.
- basicIntegrity: The device running the app likely wasn't tampered with.

The attestation result looks as follows.

~~~
{
  "nonce": "R2Rra24fVm5xa2Mg",
  "timestampMs": 9860437986543,
  "apkPackageName": "com.package.name.of.requesting.app",
  "apkCertificateDigestSha256": ["base64 encoded, SHA-256 hash of the
                                  certificate used to sign requesting app"],
  "apkDigestSha256": "base64 encoded, SHA-256 hash of the app's APK",
  "ctsProfileMatch": true,
  "basicIntegrity": true,
}
~~~

###### Programmatic Detection

**File checks**

Perhaps the most widely used method is checking for files typically found on rooted devices, such as app packages of common rooting tools and associated files:

~~~
/system/app/Superuser.apk
/system/xbin/daemonsu
/system/etc/init.d/99SuperSUDaemon
/dev/com.koushikdutta.superuser.daemon/
~~~

Binaries that are usually installed once a device is rooted. Examples include checking for the *su* binary at different locations:

~~~
/sbin/su
/system/bin/su
/system/xbin/su
/system/xbin/busybox
/data/local/su
/data/local/xbin/su
~~~ 

Alternatively, checking whether *su* is in PATH also works:

~~~java
    public static boolean checkRoot(){
        for(String pathDir : System.getenv("PATH").split(":")){
            if(new File(pathDir, "su").exists()) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
~~~

**Executing su and other commands**

Another way of determining whether su exists is attempting to execute it through <code>Runtime.getRuntime.exec()</code>. This will throw an IOException if su is not in PATH. The same method can be used to check for other programs often found on rooted devices, such as busybox or the symbolic links that typically point to it.

**Checking running processes**

Su on Android depends on a background process called *daemonsu*, so the presence of process is another sign of a rooted device. Running processes can be enumerated through ActivityManager.getRunningAppProcesses() API, the *ps* command, or walking through the */proc* directory.

**Checking installed app packages**

The Android package manager can be used to obtain a list of installed packages.

~~~
com.thirdparty.superuser
eu.chainfire.supersu
com.noshufou.android.su
com.koushikdutta.superuser
com.zachspong.temprootremovejb
com.ramdroid.appquarantine
~~~

**Checking for writable partitions and system directories**

Unusual permissions on system directories can indicate a customized or rooted device. While under normal circumstances, the system and data directories are always mounted as read-only, you'll sometimes find them mounted as read-write when the device is rooted. This can be tested for by checking whether these filesystems have been mounted with the "rw" flag, or attempting to create a file in these directories

**Checking for custom Android builds**

Besides checking whether the device is rooted, it is also helpful to check for signs of test builds and custom ROMs. One method of doing this is checking whether the BUILD tag contains test-keys, which normally indicates a custom Android image [5]. This can be checked as follows [6]:

~~~
private boolean isTestKeyBuild()
{
String str = Build.TAGS;
if ((str != null) && (str.contains("test-keys")));
for (int i = 1; ; i = 0)
  return i;
}
~~~

Missing Google Over-The-Air (OTA) certificates are another sign of a custom ROM, as on stock Android builds, OTA updates use Google's public certificates [3].

##### Bypassing Root-Detection

You can use a number of techniques to bypass these checks, most of which were introduced in the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter:

1. Renaming binaries. For example, in some cases simply renaming the "su" binary to something else is enough to defeat root detection (try not to break your enviroment though!).
2. Unmounting /proc to prevent reading of process lists etc.
2. Using Frida or Xposed to hook APIs on the Java and native layers. By doing this, you can hide files and processes, hide the actual content of files, or return all kinds of bogus values the app requests;
3. Hooking low-level APIs using Kernel modules.
4. Patching the app to remove the checks.

#### Static Analysis

Check the original or decompiled source code for the presence of root detection mechanisms, and compare them against the following criteria:

- Multiple detection methods are scattered throughout the app (as opposed to putting everything into a single method);
- The root detection mechanisms operate on multiple API layers (Java API, native library functions, Assembler / system calls);
- Some of the mechanisms show some level of originality (no copy/paste from StackOverflow or other sources);
- The mechanisms are well-integrated with other defenses (e.g. root detection functions are obfuscated and protected from tampering).

#### Dynamic Analysis

Attempt to identify and bypass the root detection mechanisms implemented. You'll most likely find that a combination of the methods above, or variations of those methods, are used. If you're performing a black-box resiliency assessment, disabling all root detection mechanisms is your first step.

Run execution traces using JDB, DDMS, strace and/or Kernel modules to find out what the app is doing - you'll usually see all kinds of suspect interactions with the operating system, such as opening *su* for reading or obtaining a list of processes. These interactions are surefire signs of root detection. Identify and deactivate the root detection mechanisms one-by-one.

#### Remediation

If the root detection mechanisms are found to be insufficient, propose additional checks so the protection scheme fulfills the criteria listed above.

### Testing Anti-Debugging

#### Overview

Debugging is a highly effective way of analyzing the runtime behaviour of an app. It allows the reverse engineer to step through the code, stop execution of the app at arbitrary point, inspect the state of variables, read and modify memory, and a lot more.

As mentioned in the "Reverse Engineering and Tampering" chapter, we have to deal with two different debugging protocols on Android: One could debug on the Java level using JDWP, or on the native layer using a ptrace-based debugger. Consequently, a good anti-debugging scheme needs to implement defenses against both debugger types.

Anti-debugging features can be preventive or reactive. As the name implies, preventive anti-debugging tricks prevent the debugger from attaching in the first place, while reactive tricks attempt to detect whether a debugger is present and react to it in some way (e.g. terminating the app, or triggering some kind of hidden behaviour). The "more-is-better" rule applies: To maximize effectiveness, one should combine multiple defenses that rely on different methods of prevention and detection, operate on multiple different API layers, and are distributed throughout the app. 

##### Sample Anti-JDWP-Debugging Methods

In the chapter "Reverse Engineering and Tampering", we introduced JDWP, the protocol used for communication between the debugger and the Java virtual machine. We also showed that it easily possible to enable debugging for any app by either patching its Manifest file, or enabling debugging for all apps by changing the ro.debuggable system property. Let's look at a few things developers do to detect and/or disable JDWP debuggers.

###### Checking For Debuggable Flag

We have encountered the <code>android:debuggable</code> attribute a few times already. This flag in the app Manifest determines whether the JDWP thread is started for the app. Its value can be determined programmatically using the app's ApplicationInfo object. If the flag is set, this is an indication that the Manifest has been tampered with to enable debugging.

```java
    public static boolean isDebuggable(Context context){

        return ((context.getApplicationContext().getApplicationInfo().flags & ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE) != 0);

    }
```

###### Calling isDebuggerConnected 

The Android Debug system class offers a static method for checking whether a debugger is currently connected. The method simply returns a boolean value.

```
    public static boolean detectDebugger() {
        return Debug.isDebuggerConnected();
    }
```

Native check:

```
JNIEXPORT jboolean JNICALL Java_com_test_debugging_DebuggerConnectedJNI(JNIenv * env, jobject obj) {
    if (gDvm.debuggerConnect || gDvm.debuggerAlive)
        return JNI_TRUE;
    return JNI_FALSE;
}
```

###### Messing With JDWP Data Structures


```c
struct DvmGlobals {
    /*
     * Some options that could be worth tampering with :)
     */

    bool        jdwpAllowed;        // debugging allowed for this process?
    bool        jdwpConfigured;     // has debugging info been provided?
    JdwpTransportType jdwpTransport;
    bool        jdwpServer;
    char*       jdwpHost;
    int         jdwpPort;
    bool        jdwpSuspend;
 
    Thread*     threadList;
 
    bool        nativeDebuggerActive;
    bool        debuggerConnected;      /* debugger or DDMS is connected */
    bool        debuggerActive;         /* debugger is making requests */
    JdwpState*  jdwpState;
 
};
```

Crashing Debugger Thread on Init <sup>[2]</sup>:

```c
JNIEXPORT jboolean JNICALL Java_poc_c_crashOnInit ( JNIEnv* env , jobject ) {
  gDvm.methDalvikDdmcServer_dispatch = NULL;
}
```

##### Sample Anti-Native-Debugging Methods

Most Anti-JDWP tricks (safe for maybe timer-based checks) won't catch "classical", ptrace-based debuggers, so separate defenses are needed to defend against this type of debugging. 


###### Checking for TracerPid

Code Sample from [1]

```
    public static boolean hasTracerPid() throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("/proc/self/status")), 1000);
            String line;

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                if (line.length() > tracerpid.length()) {
                    if (line.substring(0, tracerpid.length()).equalsIgnoreCase(tracerpid)) {
                        if (Integer.decode(line.substring(tracerpid.length() + 1).trim()) > 0) {
                            return true;
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }

        } catch (Exception exception) {
            exception.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            reader.close();
        }
        return false;
    }
```

##### Bypassing Debugger Detection

As usual, there is no generic way of bypassing anti-debugging: It depends on the particular mechanism(s) used to prevent or detect debugging, as well as other defenses in the overall protection scheme. For example, if there are no integrity checks, or you have already deactivated them, patching the app might be the easiest way. In other cases, using a hooking framework or kernel modules might be preferable.

1. Patching out the anti-debugging functionality. Disable the unwanted behaviour by simply overwriting it with NOP instructions. Note that more complex patches might be required if the anti-debugging mechanism is well thought-out.
2. Using Frida or Xposed to hook APIs on the Java and native layers. Manipulate the return values of functions such as isDebuggable and isDebuggerConnected to hide the debugger.
3. Change the environment. Android is an open enviroment. If nothing else works, you can modify the operating system to subvert the assumptions the developers made when designing the anti-debugging tricks.

-- TODO [Bypassing Debugger Detection] --

```python

#v0.1
 
import frida
import sys
 
session = frida.get_remote_device().attach("com.example.targetapp")
 
script = session.create_script("""
 
var funcPtr = Module.findExportByName("libdvm.so", "_Z25dvmDbgIsDebuggerConnectedv");
Interceptor.replace(funcPtr, new NativeCallback(function (pathPtr, flags) {
    return 0;
}, 'int', []));
""") 

def on_message(message, data):
    print(message)
 
script.on('message', on_message)
script.load()
sys.stdin.read()
```

#### White-box Testing

(Describe how to assess this with access to the source code and build configuration)

#### Black-box Testing

-- TODO [Black-box testing of anti-debugging] --

Note that some anti-debugging implementations respond in a stealthy way so that changes in behaviour are not immediately apparent. For example, a soft token app might not visibly respond when a debugger is detected, but instead secretly alter the state of an internal variable so that an incorrect OTP is generated at a later point. Make sure to run through the complete workflow to determine if attaching the debugger causes a crash or malfunction.

### Testing File Integrity Checks

#### Overview

In the "Tampering and Reverse Engineering" chapter, we discussed Android's APK signature check and showed how to re-package and re-sign apps for reverse engineering purposes. Adding additional integrity checks to the app itself makes this process a bit more involved. A comprehensive protection scheme should include CRC checks on the app bytecode and native libraries as well as important data files. It is recommended to implement these checks both on the Java and native layer.

##### Sample Implementation

From the Android Cracking Blog <sup>[1]</sup>:

```java
private void crcTest() throws IOException {
 boolean modified = false;
 
 // required dex crc value stored as a text string.
 // it could be any invisible layout element
 long dexCrc = Long.parseLong(Main.MyContext.getString(R.string.dex_crc));
 
 ZipFile zf = new ZipFile(Main.MyContext.getPackageCodePath());
 ZipEntry ze = zf.getEntry("classes.dex");
 
 if ( ze.getCrc() != dexCrc ) {
  // dex has been modified
  modified = true;
 }
 else {
  // dex not tampered with
  modified = false;
 }
}
```

### Testing Obfuscation

#### Overview

Application Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated code, by making source or machine code to be difficult for humans to understand. Obfuscated code will complicate reverse engineering and it is valuable for application that uses security-sensitive feature. Many Obfuscation does code shrinking to make APK as small as possible and the subject is well covered in other forums or Android Developer manual, hence we will only be focusing on code obfuscation. 


##### Simple Tricks

- Modifying the DEX file so static analysis tools can't load it;
- Using dynamic class loading and reflection to obfuscated the control flow;
- Pack or encrypt portions of the code and/or data;
- Frequently jumping between Java and native code.

![Identifier Renaming with ProGuard](Images/Chapters/0x05j/proguard.jpg)
*Identifier renaming with ProGuard.*

#### Static Analysis

Obfuscation can be identify easily by decompiling the code and examine if method and class names are gibberish. It is also important to audit “guild.gradle” file and Proguard configuration to examine the obfuscation settings. 

##### With Source Code

If source code is provided, build.gradle file can be check to see if obfuscation settings are set. From the example below, we can see that minifyEnabled and proguardFiles are set. It is common to see application exempts some class from obfuscation with "-keepclassmembers" and "-keep class", so it is important to audit proguard configuration file to see what class are exempted. The getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt') method gets the default ProGuard settings from the Android SDK tools/proguard/ folder and proguard-rules.pro is where you defined custom proguard rules. From our sample proguard-rules.pro file, we can see that many classes that extend common android classes are exempted, which should be done more granular on exempting specific classes or library.

build.gradle
```
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'),
                    'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

proguard-rules.pro
```
-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity
-keep public class * extends android.app.Application
-keep public class * extends android.app.Service
```


##### Without Source Code

If source code is not provided, apk can be decompile to verify if codebase have been obfuscated. dex2jar can be used to convert dex code to jar file. Tools like JD-GUI can be used to check if class, method and variable name is human readable. 

Sample obfuscated code block 
```
package com.a.a.a;

import com.a.a.b.a;
import java.util.List;

class a$b
  extends a
{
  public a$b(List paramList)
  {
    super(paramList);
  }

  public boolean areAllItemsEnabled()
  {
    return true;
  }

  public boolean isEnabled(int paramInt)
  {
    return true;
  }
}
```
