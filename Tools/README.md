# Tools

## Overview

This directory is for tools that are used to generate the necessary files for our release-channels.

## Channels

- Gitbook: currenlty using @sushi2k's repository which is synced manually.
- Github release: currently using travis to automatically build stuff based on a tag. See ../travis.yml. It uses `gendocs.sh`, `generate_document.sh` and `gitbookepubanpdf.sh`.
- Leanpub: `updateLeanpub.sh` is in the making: for now it contains only instructions.

## Files

- Apply_Link_Check.sh: used to check whether there are any broken links in the markdown files. Requires `markdown-link-check` to be installed.
- Apply_Linter_Check.sh: used to check whether there are any markdown markup issues. Requires `markdownlint-cli` to be installed.
- before_install.sh: script used by the Travis pipeline to check which tools need to be installed depending on whether it is a pull-request or a tag has been added for a release.
- book.json: the book.json metadata template for Gitbook. Necessary for `gitbookepubanpdf.sh` to automatically create an updated book.json in the root of the folder.
- gendocs.sh: used to simplify the work with Travis.
- gendocsLocal.sh: used to simplify the work with Travis, but then on your local machine (partially).
- generate_document.sh: used to generate the docx and html files.
- generate_toc.rb: used to generate a TOC file.
- gitbookepubandpdf.sh: used to generate the epub, pdf and mobi files.
- metadata.yml: used by pandoc for generating docx files with `generate_Document.sh`.
- omtg-pre-commit.sh: older not maintained hook for automatically triggering `generate_toc.rb`.
- reference.docx: templatefile used for generating the word doc using `generate_document.sh`.
