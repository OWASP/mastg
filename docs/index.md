## Our Mission

> "Define the industry standard for mobile application security."

The OWASP Mobile Application Security (MAS) flagship project provides a security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive testing guide (OWASP MASTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

<br><br><br>

## Trusted by ...

The OWASP MASVS and MASTG are trusted by the following platform providers and standardization, governmental and educational institutions. [Learn more](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02b-MASVS-MASTG-Adoption.md).

### OWASP MASVS

The OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard) is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results.

_Previously known as OWASP MSTG (Mobile Security Testing Guide)_

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the [OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs).
