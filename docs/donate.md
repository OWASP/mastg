# ♡ Donations

While both the MASVS and the MASTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. If you'd like to support the Mobile Security Testing project we'll be happy to accept your donations. You may donate 5, 500, 5000 (USD/EUR/GBP) or any custom amount. Certain amounts allow you to opt-in for a "[Donation Package](#donation-packages)" (see below).

100% of the funds raised go directly to the OWASP foundation and allow us to ask for budget to fund our project activities:

- Editing and proofreading by professional editors.
- Graphic design and layout improvements.
- Improving our automated delivery pipelines.
- Acquiring new test devices if certain tests can not be executed on existing emulators/simulators/test devices.

## Donators

We thank our donators for providing the funds to support us on our project activities. The Donation Packages are described on the [Donation page](#donation-packages).

**The OWASP Foundation is very grateful for the support by the individuals and organizations listed. However please note, the OWASP Foundation is strictly vendor neutral and does not endorse any of its supporters. Donations do not influence the content of the MASVS or MASTG in any way.**
