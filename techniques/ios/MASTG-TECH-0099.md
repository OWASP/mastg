title: Intercepting Non-proxy-aware HTTP Traffic
platform: ios
---


Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google. It is used for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses Dart, which is not proxy-aware and uses its own certificate store.The application doesnâ€™t take proxy configuration from the system and send the data directly to the server.Due to this,it is not possible to intercept the request using the BurpSuite or any MITM tools.



## Intercepting Traffic using re-fultter

1. The re-Fultter supports both android and ios flutter applications.
2. Install the [reflutter](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter.git).
3. Run the command to patch the application.
```
$ reflutter demo.ipa
```
4. It prompts to choose two options:
```
$ reflutter demo.ipa 

 Choose an option: 

 1. Traffic monitoring and interception 
 2. Display absolute code offset for functions

[1/2]? 
```
5. Select  the **Traffic monitoring and interception**.
6. It prompts **Please enter your BurpSuite IP**. Enter the **IP** of the machine which the BurpSuite is running.
```
$ reflutter demo.ipa 

 Choose an option: 

 1. Traffic monitoring and interception 
 2. Display absolute code offset for functions
 [1/2]? 1

Example: (192.168.1.154) etc.
Please enter your BurpSuite IP: 192.168.0.123
```
7. This will create a patched **release.RE.ipa** file.
```
SnapshotHash: 7dbbeeb8ef7bdfd91338640dca3927636de
The resulting ipa file: ./release.RE.ipa
Please install the ipa file

Configure Burp Suite proxy server to listen on *:8083
Proxy Tab -> Options -> Proxy Listeners -> Edit -> Binding Tab

Then enable invisible proxying in Request Handling Tab
Support Invisible Proxying -> true
``` 
8. [Re-sign](../../techniques/ios/MASTG-TECH-0092.md) the application with the Apple certificates.
9. Install the re-signed application on the mobile device.
10. Configure the Burp-suite:
    - Under Proxy -> Proxy settings -> Add new Proxy setting.
    - Bind listening Port to **8083**.
    - Select Bind to address to **All interfaces**. 
    - Request Handling -> support for invisible proxying.
11. Open the Application and start intercepting the requests from the applications.
