## Overview

## Static Analysis

When you have access to the source code of an iOS app, identify sensitive data that's saved and processed throughout the app. This includes passwords, secret keys, and personally identifiable information (PII), but it may as well include other data identified as sensitive by industry regulations, laws, and company policies. Look for this data being saved via any of the local storage APIs listed below.

Make sure that sensitive data is never stored without appropriate protection. For example, authentication tokens should not be saved in `NSUserDefaults` without additional encryption. Also avoid storing encryption keys in `.plist` files, hardcoded as strings in code, or generated using a predictable obfuscation function or key derivation function based on stable attributes.

Sensitive data should be stored by using the Keychain API (that stores them inside the Secure Enclave), or stored encrypted using envelope encryption. Envelope encryption, or key wrapping, is a cryptographic construct that uses symmetric encryption to encapsulate key material. Data encryption keys (DEK) can be encrypted with key encryption keys (KEK) which must be securely stored in the Keychain. Encrypted DEK can be stored in `NSUserDefaults` or written in files. When required, application reads KEK, then decrypts DEK. Refer to [OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#encrypting-stored-keys "OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet: Encrypting Stored Keys") to learn more about encrypting cryptographic keys.

### Keychain

The encryption must be implemented so that the secret key is stored in the Keychain with secure settings, ideally `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly`. This ensures the usage of hardware-backed storage mechanisms. Make sure that the `AccessControlFlags` are set according to the security policy of the keys in the KeyChain.

[Generic examples of using the KeyChain](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/GenericKeychain/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007797-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2 "GenericKeyChain") to store, update, and delete data can be found in the official Apple documentation. The official Apple documentation also includes an example of using [Touch ID and passcode protected keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/accessing_keychain_items_with_face_id_or_touch_id "Accessing Keychain Items with Face ID or Touch ID").

### Filesystem

Using the source code, examine the different APIs used to store data locally. Make sure that any data is properly encrypted based on its sensitivity.

## Dynamic Analysis

One way to determine whether sensitive information (like credentials and keys) is stored insecurely without leveraging native iOS functions is to analyze the app's data directory. Triggering all app functionality before the data is analyzed is important because the app may store sensitive data only after specific functionality has been triggered. You can then perform static analysis for the data dump according to generic keywords and app-specific data.

The following steps can be used to determine how the application stores data locally on a jailbroken iOS device:

1. Trigger the functionality that stores potentially sensitive data.
2. Connect to the iOS device and navigate to its Bundle directory (this applies to iOS versions 8.0 and above): `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/$APP_ID/`
3. Execute grep with the data that you've stored, for example: `grep -iRn "USERID"`.
4. If the sensitive data is stored in plaintext, the app fails this test.

You can analyze the app's data directory on a non-jailbroken iOS device by using third-party applications, such as [iMazing](https://imazing.com "iMazing").

1. Trigger the functionality that stores potentially sensitive data.
2. Connect the iOS device to your host computer and launch iMazing.
3. Select "Apps", right-click the desired iOS application, and select "Extract App".
4. Navigate to the output directory and locate `$APP_NAME.imazing`. Rename it to `$APP_NAME.zip`.
5. Unpack the ZIP file. You can then analyze the application data.

> Note that tools like iMazing don't copy data directly from the device. They try to extract data from the backups they create. Therefore, getting all the app data that's stored on the iOS device is impossible: not all folders are included in backups. Use a jailbroken device or repackage the app with Frida and use a tool like objection to access all the data and files.

If you added the Frida library to the app and repackaged it as described in "Dynamic Analysis on Non-Jailbroken Devices" (from the "Tampering and Reverse Engineering on iOS" chapter), you can use [objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection "objection") to transfer files directly from the app's data directory or [read files in objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Using-objection#getting-started-ios-edition "Getting started iOS edition") as explained in the chapter "Basic Security Testing on iOS", section "[Host-Device Data Transfer](../../../Document/0x06b-iOS-Security-Testing.md#host-device-data-transfer "Host-Device Data Transfer")".

The Keychain contents can be dumped during dynamic analysis. On a jailbroken device, you can use [Keychain dumper](https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/ "Keychain Dumper") as described in the chapter "Basic Security Testing on iOS".

The path to the Keychain file is

```bash
/private/var/Keychains/keychain-2.db
```

On a non-jailbroken device, you can use objection to [dump the Keychain items](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Notes-About-The-Keychain-Dumper "Notes About The Keychain Dumper") created and stored by the app.

### Dynamic Analysis with Xcode and iOS simulator

> This test is only available on macOS, as Xcode and the iOS simulator is needed.

For testing the local storage and verifying what data is stored within it, it's not mandatory to have an iOS device. With access to the source code and Xcode the app can be build and deployed in the iOS simulator. The file system of the current device of the iOS simulator is available in `~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices`.

Once the app is running in the iOS simulator, you can navigate to the directory of the latest simulator started with the following command:

```bash
$ cd ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/$(
ls -alht ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices | head -n 2 |
awk '{print $9}' | sed -n '1!p')/data/Containers/Data/Application
```

The command above will automatically find the UUID of the latest simulator started. Now you still need to grep for your app name or a keyword in your app. This will show you the UUID of the app.

```bash
grep -iRn keyword .
```

Then you can monitor and verify the changes in the filesystem of the app and investigate if any sensitive information is stored within the files while using the app.

### Dynamic Analysis with Objection

You can use the [objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection "objection") runtime mobile exploration toolkit to find vulnerabilities caused by the application's data storage mechanism. Objection can be used without a Jailbroken device, but it will require [patching the iOS Application](https://github.com/sensepost/objection/wiki/Patching-iOS-Applications "Objection").

#### Reading the Keychain

To use Objection to read the Keychain, execute the following command:

```bash
...itudehacks.DVIAswiftv2.develop on (iPhone: 13.2.3) [usb] # ios keychain dump
Note: You may be asked to authenticate using the devices passcode or TouchID
Save the output by adding `--json keychain.json` to this command
