title: Testing User Education on Security Best Practices

## Overview

Testing this might be especially challenging if you intend to automate it. We recommend using the app extensively and try to answer the following questions whenever applicable:

- **Fingerprint usage**: when fingerprints are used for authentication providing access to high-risk transactions/information,

    _does the app inform the user about potential issues when having multiple fingerprints of other people registered to the device as well?_

- **Rooting/Jailbreaking**: when root or jailbreak detection is implemented,

    _does the app inform the user of the fact that certain high-risk actions will carry additional risk due to the jailbroken/rooted status of the device?_

- **Specific credentials**: when a user gets a recovery code, a password or a pin from the application (or sets one),

    _does the app instruct the user to never share this with anyone else and that only the app will request it?_

- **Application distribution**: in case of a high-risk application and in order to prevent users from downloading compromised versions of the application,

    _does the app manufacturer properly communicate the official way of distributing the app (e.g. from Google Play or the App Store)?_

- **Prominent Disclosure**: in any case,

    _does the app display prominent disclosure of data access, collection, use, and sharing? e.g. does the app use the [App Tracking Transparency Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency) to ask for the permission on iOS?_
