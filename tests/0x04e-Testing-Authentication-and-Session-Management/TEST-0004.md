title: Testing Session Timeout

## Overview

Minimizing the lifetime of session identifiers and tokens decreases the likelihood of successful account hijacking.

## Static Analysis

In most popular frameworks, you can set the session timeout via configuration options. This parameter should be set according to the best practices specified in the framework documentation. The recommended timeout may be between 10 minutes and two hours, depending on the app's sensitivity. Refer to the framework documentation for examples of session timeout configuration:

- [Spring (Java)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web.spring-session "Spring (Java)")
- [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-expiry "Ruby on Rails")
- [PHP](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime "PHP")
- [ASP.Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.sessionstate.httpsessionstate.timeout "ASP.NET")

## Dynamic Analysis

To verify if a session timeout is implemented, proxy your requests through an interception proxy and perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the application.
2. Access a resource that requires authentication, typically a request for private information belonging to your account.
3. Try to access the data after an increasing number of 5-minute delays has passed (5, 10, 15, ...).
4. Once the resource is no longer available, you will know the session timeout.

After you have identified the session timeout, verify whether it has an appropriate length for the application. If the timeout is too long, or if the timeout does not exist, this test case fails.

> When using Burp Proxy, you can use the [Session Timeout Test extension](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/c4bfd29882974712a1d69c6d8f05874e "Session Timeout Test extension") to automate this test.
