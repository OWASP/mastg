## Overview

Password strength is a key concern when passwords are used for authentication. The password policy defines requirements to which end users should adhere. A password policy typically specifies password length, password complexity, and password topologies. A "strong" password policy makes manual or automated password cracking difficult or impossible. The following sections will cover various areas regarding password best practices. For further information please consult the [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#implement-proper-password-strength-controls "Implement Proper Password Strength Controls").

## Static Analysis

Confirm the existence of a password policy and verify the implemented password complexity requirements according to the [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#implement-proper-password-strength-controls "Implement Proper Password Strength Controls") which focuses on length and an unlimited character set. Identify all password-related functions in the source code and make sure that a verification check is performed in each of them. Review the password verification function and make sure that it rejects passwords that violate the password policy.

### zxcvbn

[zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn "zxcvbn") is a common library that can be used for estimating password strength, inspired by password crackers. It is available in JavaScript but also for many other programming languages on the server side. There are different methods of installation, please check the Github repo for your preferred method. Once installed, zxcvbn can be used to calculate the complexity and the amount of guesses to crack the password.

After adding the zxcvbn JavaScript library to the HTML page, you can execute the command `zxcvbn` in the browser console, to get back detailed information about how likely it is to crack the password including a score.

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04e/zxcvbn.png" width="100%" />

The score is defined as follows and can be used for a password strength bar for example:

```html
0 # too guessable: risky password. (guesses < 10^3)

1 # very guessable: protection from throttled online attacks. (guesses < 10^6)

2 # somewhat guessable: protection from unthrottled online attacks. (guesses < 10^8)

3 # safely unguessable: moderate protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses < 10^10)

4 # very unguessable: strong protection from offline slow-hash scenario. (guesses >= 10^10)
```

Note that zxcvbn can be implemented by the app-developer as well using the Java (or other) implementation in order to guide the user into creating a strong password.

## Have I Been Pwned: PwnedPasswords

In order to further reduce the likelihood of a successful dictionary attack against a single factor authentication scheme (e.g. password only), you can verify whether a password has been compromised in a data breach. This can be done using services based on the Pwned Passwords API by Troy Hunt (available at api.pwnedpasswords.com). For example, the "[Have I been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com "\';--have i been pwned?")" companion website.
Based on the SHA-1 hash of a possible password candidate, the API returns the number of times the hash of the given password has been found in the various breaches collected by the service. The workflow takes the following steps:

- Encode the user input to UTF-8 (e.g.: the password `test`).
- Take the SHA-1 hash of the result of step 1 (e.g.: the hash of `test` is `A94A8FE5CC...`).
- Copy the first 5 characters (the hash prefix) and use them for a range-search by  using the following API: `http GET https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/A94A8`
- Iterate through the result and look for the rest of the hash (e.g. is `FE5CC...` part of the returned list?). If it is not part of the returned list, then the password for the given hash has not been found. Otherwise, as in case of `FE5CC...`, it will return a counter showing how many times it has been found in breaches (e.g.: `FE5CC...:76479`).

Further documentation on the Pwned Passwords API can be found [online](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3 "Api Docs V3").

Note that this API is best used by the app-developer when the user needs to register and enter a password to check whether it is a recommended password or not.

### Login Throttling

Check the source code for a throttling procedure: a counter for logins attempted in a short period of time with a given user name and a method to prevent login attempts after the maximum number of attempts has been reached. After an authorized login attempt, the error counter should be reset.

Observe the following best practices when implementing anti-brute-force controls:

- After a few unsuccessful login attempts, targeted accounts should be locked (temporarily or permanently), and additional login attempts should be rejected.
- A five-minute account lock is commonly used for temporary account locking.
- The controls must be implemented on the server because client-side controls are easily bypassed.
- Unauthorized login attempts must be tallied with respect to the targeted account, not a particular session.

Additional brute force mitigation techniques are described on the OWASP page [Blocking Brute Force Attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks "OWASP - Blocking Brute Force Attacks").

## Dynamic Testing (MSTG-AUTH-6)

Automated password guessing attacks can be performed using a number of tools. For HTTP(S) services, using an interception proxy is a viable option. For example, you can use [Burp Suite Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/using "Using Burp Suite Intruder") to perform both wordlist-based and brute-force attacks.

> Please keep in mind that the Burp Suite Community Edition has significant limitations apart from not being able to save projects. For example, a throttling mechanism will be activated after several requests that will slow down your attacks with Burp Intruder dramatically. Also no built-in password lists are available in this version. If you want to execute a real brute force attack use either [Burp Suite](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#burp-suite) Professional or [OWASP ZAP](0x08a-Testing-Tools.md#owasp-zap).

Execute the following steps for a wordlist based brute force attack with Burp Intruder:

- Start Burp Suite Professional.
- Create a new project (or open an existing one).
- Set up your mobile device to use Burp as the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Log into the mobile app and intercept the authentication request sent to the backend service.
- Right-click this request on the **Proxy/HTTP History** tab and select **Send to Intruder** in the context menu.
- Select the **Intruder** tab. For further information on how to use [Burp Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/using "Using Burp Intruder") read the official documentation on Portswigger.
- Make sure all parameters in the **Target**, **Positions**, and **Options** tabs are appropriately set and select the **Payload** tab.
- Load or paste the list of passwords you want to try. There are several resources available that offer password lists, like [FuzzDB](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/ "FuzzDB"), the built-in lists in Burp Intruder or the files available in `/usr/share/wordlists` on Kali Linux.

Once everything is configured and you have a word-list selected, you're ready to start the attack!

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04e/BurpIntruderInputList.png" width="400px" />

- Click the **Start attack** button to attack the authentication.

A new window will open. Site requests are sent sequentially, each request corresponding to a password from the list. Information about the response (length, status code, etc.) is provided for each request, allowing you to distinguish successful and unsuccessful attempts:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x04e/BurpIntruderSuccessfulAttack.png" width="400px" />

In this example, you can identify the successful attempt according to the different length and the HTTP status code, which reveals the password 12345.

To test if your own test accounts are prone to brute forcing, append the correct password of your test account to the end of the password list. The list shouldn't have more than 25 passwords. If you can complete the attack without permanently or temporarily locking the account or solving a CAPTCHA after a certain amount of requests with wrong passwords, that means the account isn't protected against brute force attacks.

> Tip: Perform these kinds of tests only at the very end of your penetration test. You don't want to lock out your account on the first day of testing and potentially having to wait for it to be unlocked. For some projects unlocking accounts might be more difficult than you think.
