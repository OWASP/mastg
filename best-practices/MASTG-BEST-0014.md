Ensure that the app hides sensitive content, such as credit card details and passcodes, from screen readers. Malware may attempt to capture screen output to extract confidential information. Make sure that the keyboard view is also protected as it may leak keystrokes for the passcode fields.

Screenshots may be saved in locations that are accessible to other applications.
