AppSync Unified disables various IPA signature verifications on jailbroken iOS devices, allowing you to install IPA files with missing or incorrect signatures. AppSync Unified does not require any configuration after installation.

!!! warning

    You can normally install AppSync Unified from the `https://cydia.akemi.ai/` repository by adding it to the package manager on your iOS device. However, as this repository is not always available, we recommend building it from source and installing the created .deb file using `dpkg -i` on your device.
