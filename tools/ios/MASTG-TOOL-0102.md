Fixed md lint and other errors, also added some minor text improvements.

We recommend to install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint in your vscode to prevent this in the future.

Also, please be careful with punctuation and spacing, for example: 
- `is GUI for macOS.With this` (a white space after `.` was missing)
-  `installed via brew on macOS :` (the whitespace before `:` shouldn't be there.
