The [Pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat) tool acts as a wrapper for adb logcat and includes an update to Jeff Sharkey's remarkable [logcat color script](https://jsharkey.org/logcat/). It facilitates the viewing of Android log entries for specific application packages in a visually distinct color format. This script effectively filters logs by application package, allowing us to input the target package as the only argument to the python script.
