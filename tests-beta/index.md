# New MASTG "Atomic Tests" (Beta)

The MASTG "Atomic Tests" are a new addition to the MASTG project. They are a collection of small, individual tests that can be used to assess the security of a mobile application. Each test is designed to be simple and focused on a single security issue. The goal is to make it easier for developers and security professionals to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in their mobile applications.

The MASTG "Atomic Tests" are organized into categories based on the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and have a weakness assigned from the OWASP Mobile Application Security Weakness Enumeration (MASWE).

Each test includes:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the security issue being tested.
- **Steps**: Detailed instructions on how to test for the security issue.
- **Observation**: The output of the test and what it means.
- **Evaluation**: How to interpret the results of the test.

The MASTG "Atomic Tests" are currently in beta and are being actively developed. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community. If you have suggestions for new tests or improvements to existing tests, please open an issue or pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg).
