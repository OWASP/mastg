# Testing Enforced Updating (Android)

Many mobile applications enforce updates to ensure users are on the latest version, typically for security and feature enhancements. However, if the enforcement mechanism is weak, attackers may bypass the update requirement and continue using outdated, vulnerable versions of the app.

This test evaluates how an Android app enforces updates and checks whether an attacker can bypass the mechanism through static, dynamic, or network-based attacks.

---

## **1. Static Analysis: Reverse Engineering Update Mechanism**

**Goal:** Identify how the app determines whether an update is required.

1. **Decompile the APK** using JADX or Apktool:

   ```bash
   apktool d app.apk -o decompiled_app
   jadx -d decompiled_app app.apk
   ```

2. Search for update-related logic in the decompiled code:

   ```bash
   grep -Ri "update" decompiled_app
   ```

3. Identify how the app determines whether an update is required. Look for:
   - Hardcoded version checks (BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE)
   - API calls to check for updates
   - Update prompts in MainActivity.java

## **2. Dynamic Analysis: Hooking Update Logic with Frida**

**Goal:** Determine if the update check can be bypassed.

1. Attach Frida to the Running App:

   ```bash
   frida -U -n com.example.app -e "console.log('Frida attached!')"
   ```

2. Hook & Modify Update Functions:

   ```javascript
   Java.perform(function() {
       var UpdateChecker = Java.use("com.example.app.UpdateManager");
       UpdateChecker.isUpdateRequired.implementation = function() {
           console.log("Bypassing update check...");
           return false;
       };
   });
   ```

3. Check If the App Still Requires an Update
   - If the app allows continued usage without updating, the update mechanism is weak and bypassable.
   - If the app still forces the update, the check may be server-side, which is more secure.

## **3. Network Analysis: Modifying Update Responses**

**Goal:** Determine if app relies on insecure network responses for updates.

1. Intercept Update Requests Using Burp Suite or mitmproxy
   Set up Burp Suite or mitmproxy to capture app traffic.

   ```bash
   mitmproxy -p 8080 -m transparent
   ```

2. Modify the Update Response
   If the update check is done via an API call (e.g., GET /check_update), intercept and modify the response:

   ```json
   {
     "latest_version": "2.0.0",
     "force_update": false
   }
   ```

   Change "force_update": false to "force_update": true and observe if the app still allows access.

## Observation

After executing the test steps, analyze the results:

### Secure Behavior (Pass)

- The app strictly enforces updates and cannot be bypassed through Frida or network attacks.
- Update checks are performed server-side with cryptographic verification.
- The app uses certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.

### Insecure Behavior (Fail)

- The app allows continued usage even after modifying responses.
- Frida can disable the update requirement, indicating weak enforcement.
- Update verification is completely client-side (e.g., hardcoded version checks).

---

## Mitigations

To prevent bypassing enforced updates, implement the following security controls:

- Perform update enforcement on the server side.
- Digitally sign update responses to prevent tampering.
- Use certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.
- Store the latest version information in a secure location rather than hardcoding it in the app.
- Implement a kill switch for outdated versions that enforces an update at the backend.
