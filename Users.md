Since 2021 Google has shown their support for the OWASP Mobile Security project (MSTG/MASVS) and has started providing continuous and high value feedback to the MASVS refactoring process via the [App Defense Alliance (ADA)](https://appdefensealliance.dev/) and its [MASA (Mobile Application Security Assessment) program](https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa).

With MASA, Google has acknowledged the importance of leveraging a globally recognized standard for mobile app security to the mobile app ecosystem. Developers can work directly with an Authorized Lab partner to initiate a security assessment. Google will recognize developers who have had their applications independently validated against a set of MASVS Level 1 requirements and will showcase this on their Data safety section.

We thank Google, the ADA and all its members for their support and for their excellent work on protecting the mobile app ecosystem.

## Standards, frameworks and guidelines recommending the MASVS and MSTG

Currently, the MASVS and MSTG are trusted by the following standardization institutions.

### NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States)

- [NIST.SP.800-163 "Vetting the Security of Mobile Applications", Revision 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2019/nist-publishes-sp-800-163-rev-1 "National Institute of Standards and Technology")
- [NIST.SP.800-218 "Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) v1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities"](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf)

### BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Germany)

### ioXt

<img width="300px" src="Document/Images/Other/ioxt-logo.png"/>

The mission of the [ioXt Alliance](https://www.ioxtalliance.org/) is to build confidence in Internet of Things products through multi-stakeholder, international, harmonized, and standardized security and privacy requirements, product compliance programs, and public transparency of those requirements and programs.

In 2021, ioXt has [extended its security principles through the Mobile Application profile](https://www.ioxtalliance.org/news-events-blog/ioxt-alliance-expands-certification-program-for-mobile-and-vpn-security), so that app developers can ensure their products are built with, and maintain, high cybersecurity standards such as the OWASP MASVS and the VPN Trust Initiative. The ioXt Mobile Application profile is a security standard that applies to any cloud connected mobile app and provides the much needed market transparency for consumer and commercial mobile app security.
